# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to project the amount of employees that will be retiring within the next few years. The company would like to know who will be retiring as well as an estimate of when they are going to retire. They also would like to prepare retirement packages as well as prepare to fill a retiree's position with a new hire. Unforturnely, the data is held within Excel and would like to create a database using SQL. 

## Results

The image below is part of the result of combining the employees and titles tables for employees that are born between 1952 and 1955. Some of the employees hold two rows of data due to promotions or movement from one department to another.

The image below is the unique titles table which takes the data from the employees and titles tables and only pulls one row of data per employee.

  * The amount of employees that are within the retirement age are in the tens of thousands who also mostly hold senior level titles. This could increase the difficulty     of finding adequent hires to fill their positions
