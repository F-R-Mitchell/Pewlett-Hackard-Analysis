# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to project the amount of employees that will be retiring within the next few years. The company would like to know who will be retiring as well as an estimate of when they are going to retire. They also would like to prepare retirement packages as well as prepare to fill a retiree's position with a new hire. Unforturnely, the data is held within Excel and would like to begin using SQL.
